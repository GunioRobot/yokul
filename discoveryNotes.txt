CHBH
=====
CHBH specifies spacing for bars and bar groups. However, it behaves differently if there are no groups

Chart has groups
-------
CHBH acts as expected, it specifies width of bar, spacing between bars, and spacing between groups

Chart has no groups (only one data set)
-------
In this case, spacing between groups becomes the spacing between bars
